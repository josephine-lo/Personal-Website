# Personal Website
## Introduction ##
Welcome to my personal website! This can be viewed at https://josephine-lo.herokuapp.com/ or https://tinyurl.com/lo-josephine
This started as a static HTML website, but I decided to learn something new, so I took on Rails.

This website was created with Rails and deployed to Heroku.
